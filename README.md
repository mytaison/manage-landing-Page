## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

It is my first project using Tailwind CSS. Only classbased CSS writing is completely new for me. I found it very interesting. I struggled here to set the background capsule shape object according to example desgin in both desktop and mobile mode.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
